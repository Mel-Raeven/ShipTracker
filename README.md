# Description

This repository contains examples of using the AISStream API in Golang, Python, JavaScript and many more languages.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use these examples, you will need to sign up for an AISStream API key at [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io/authenticate).

### Golang Example

To run the Golang example, you will need to have Go installed on your system.

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aisstream/example`. Navigate to the golang directory: `cd example/golang`. Install the dependencies: `go get -d`. Replace `"<YOUR API KEY>"` in the `main.go` file with your AISStream API key. Run the example: `go run main.go`.

### Python Example

To run the Python example, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aisstream/example`. Navigate to the python directory: `cd example/python`. Install the dependencies: `python setup.py install`. Replace `"<YOUR API KEY>"` in the `main.py` file with your AISStream API key. Run the example: python main.py.

### JavaScript Example

To run the JavaScript example, you will need to have Node.js installed on your system.

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aisstream/example`.
Navigate to the javascript directory: `cd example/javascript`.
Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
To run the Javascript example, define the environment variable `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` with your AISStream API key.
Run the example: `node main.js`.

### C# Example

To run the C# example, you will need to have .NET 8 installed on your system.

### C Example

To build the C examples, you will need to have [CMake 3.20+](https://cmake.org) and OpenSSL installed on your system. In addition, one example (`lws.c`) requires [libwebsocket](https://libwebsockets.org/) with OpenSSL. To run the C examples, replace `"<YOUR API KEY>"` in the `lws.c` and `mg.c` files with your AISStream API key.

### C++ Examples

To build the C++ examples, you will need to have [CMake 3.20+](https://cmake.org) and OpenSSL installed on your system. Two C++ examples are available. One with [Boost.Beast](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_84_0/libs/beast/doc/html/index.html) and one with [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source).

### Rust Example

To build the Rust example, you will need to have [Rust 1.77.2+](https://www.rust-lang.org).
To run the Rust example, define the environment variable `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` with your AISStream API key.
